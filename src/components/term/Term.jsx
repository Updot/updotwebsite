          Project initiation will be strictly based on confirmation of initial
          payment. Date of initiation of the project will be intimated to the
          client once the proposal gets accepted and payment is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no refunds for any fees paid and the client stays
          responsible to pay the total amount of fees due for any project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Updot reserves the right to suspend or terminate the project if the
          customer fails to uphold the payment terms even after satisfactory
          submission of committed deliverables as per plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team reserves rights to sole ownership to all work done by Updot,
          including documents, designs, ideas or any work product, produced by

          the Client fails to settle all outstanding issues and dues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Updot also withholds the right to suspend or terminate the project if
          the customer at any point of time misbehaves with our staff or
          personnel in any given matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of violation of agreement, Updot reserves the rights to

          invoiced to the customer separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Requirements as mentioned by the client will be concerned as the final
          scope before commencement of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any change in requirements during the development phase will be
          considered as a separate change request, and the estimated cost for

          Updot Solutions will not be held responsible for any delays that arise
          due to lack of communication and support from the client side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client should provide the required content/image (if required)
          once the project has begun.

        <p>
          If the source code or design is modified by the Client without mutual
          written consent, Updot Solutions will not be held responsible for any

          communicating with the concerned team. However, past one month of
          final delivery date, Monthly maintenance charge will be levied for
          continuation of support.
